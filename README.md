Chapter 15 Exercise

  >Purpose of the app: to allow users to create events, view tags for related events, and view event details such as description, email, or type. 


	>Current state of the app: the app can display all events, categories, and tags. It can also create events, categories, and tags. 
	It can delete events. The app uses ORM (Java and MySQL) to store information. 



	>Future improvements: implementation of the Person class will allow users to create a username and password. 
	This allows them to have accounts that can RSVP to events. An EventCalendar class will allow users to view all the events on a calendar. 
  The Event class will be updated to allow for a date field when creating an event.
